1. Runs the **bonus teardowns** if the bonus labs were used (B3 DCM schemas, B2 policies/GOVERNANCE, B1 tags/FINOPS) and drops the demo resource monitor.
2. `SUSPEND_ALL()` - stops every task and dynamic table, turns notifications off.
3. `DROP DATABASE GLADSTONE_DQ_LAB` - template, every `CUST_*` schema, DMFs, semantic views, agents, budgets.
4. Drops `DQ_LAB_WH`, `DQ_LAB_RM`, `DQ_LAB_EMAIL_INT`.
5. Drops **every role named `DQ_LAB_*`**.
6. Verification: every `SHOW` returns zero rows.

- If the setup script was generated with *Set each attendee's default role*, their original `DEFAULT_ROLE` and `DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE` are restored automatically (step 2 of `98_teardown.sql`). Otherwise they were never changed.
- Temporary walk-in users, if you created any, are not dropped by the script: `DROP USER <u>;`
- Dropped data stays in Time Travel and then Fail-safe for the retention period before it is purged. All lab data is synthetic.
- Attendee laptops keep their local DCM project folders (Bonus B3).
