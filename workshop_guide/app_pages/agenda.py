**Day 2: AI/ML (75-90 min):** use AISQL to turn member feedback into features, train and register a churn model, wrap it in a stored procedure, add a semantic view, and give a Cortex Agent both. It reuses your operator schema from today.

**After the session:** three bonus labs, each with its own setup and teardown - **B1** budgets and resource monitors, **B2** governance plus GDPR, **B3** DevOps with DCM Projects.

| Fault | What happened (in Nova terms) | Symptom in Nova |
|---|---|---|
| Bifrost replay | The same merge batch was applied twice | Active members inflated |
| Merge task stalled | The sync task stopped | Stale revenue, no new bookings |
| Refund sign flip | Refunds arrived as negative payments | Today's revenue collapses |
| Orphan attendance | Check-ins arrived without their bookings | Utilisation over 100% for some classes |
